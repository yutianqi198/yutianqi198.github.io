I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Communication at Nanjing University.I enjoy anime and alternative music and am very friendly. My research focuses on the sociology of knowledge, and I hope to explore the new missions and potential pathways for intellectuals in this era of diverse and contending voices. Over the next three years of my master's program, I aspire to study diligently, grow continuously, and seek to understand myself, understand others, and ultimately gain a deeper understanding of the society we inhabit.
